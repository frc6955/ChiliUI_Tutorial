# Flask with Plotly

Example based on artical *Code Charting Using Plotly in Python* written by Roy Agasthyan (April 12, 2018). The artical can be found in [this link](https://code.tutsplus.com/tutorials/charting-using-plotly-in-python--cms-30286).


To run the code, run
```python
python main.py
```
in the terminal and direct your browser to [localhost:5000/lc](http://localhost:5000/lc). This will display a simple header followed by a plot of 500 random data points generated on every visit to the URI. The other available URI is for [multi line plotting](http://localhost:5000/mlc). This will generate 3 different traces in the same fashion as before.
